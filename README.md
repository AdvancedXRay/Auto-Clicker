## Features
- Auto click (hold & spam) for Right and Left click
- Support for AFK farms when respecting cool down
- Configurable spam timeout (speed)
- (almost) No janky key press logic, all native Minecraft key button handling.

## How to use (Subject to change)
- Open GUI with `O` (default key) to enable and edit the settings of each button being clicked
- Use `I` (default key) to enable auto clicker

### Option descriptions
- `Active`: Enables that key to be held when `Auto Clicker` is active (holding)
- `Spamming`: Enables per tick spamming meaning every tick the button is quickly pressed and un-pressed
- `Speed`: Speed controls how fast (per tick) the spamming will happen, 0 being the quickest, 10 being the fastest
- `Respect cooldown`: Will Attack only once the cooldown has cooled down :tada:

## Use on public servers

I **DO NOT** support the use of this mod on any public servers which do not allow this kind of mod. The mod **does** work on servers but I do not approve of, and will not, support anyone that attempts to use this mod on servers. I **do not** have the time to review each issue; I will simply close any issue with server connections in the crash log.

If you wish to use this mod on private servers then that's on you. If you use this on public servers and are banned then that's on you and I will **not** support your use of this mod in that way.
